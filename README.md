#### 13th Amendment
_Ratified December 6, 1865_

The 13th amendment officially outlawed slavery in the United States. It provided that “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude … shall exist within the United States”. 

It was a controversial amendment. While during the Civil War, no southerners sat in Congress to provide moral or religious defenses of slavery, the amendment divided lawmakers by party lines on grounds of “states’ rights” and federalism

 It was meant to carry out the plan set forth in the Emancipation Proclamation by Abraham Lincoln. It was ratified by nearly all Northern states, along with a sufficient number of border and reconstructed Southern states. 

Furthermore, it allowed a final federal and constitutional end to the issue of slavery by outlawing the institution in all states. 

However, the abolition of slavery was only part of the amendment, it also declared that “Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.” The Thirteenth Amendment outlawed slavery, but failed to specify the rights of black men and women. In other words, race remained a barrier towards gaining citizenship. 

#### 14th Amendment
_Ratified July 9, 1868_

The 14th amendment addresses a wide range of topics, but mainly revolves around the concept of citizenship. The amendment declares that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States” in an effort to clarify the position of freed slaves.


It also provides multiple times that those who engage in rebellion against the United States are not afforded the enumerated protections. Here the fiery rhetoric of the Radical Republicans becomes evident.


The 14th Amendment provided anyone under the jurisdiction of the law the right to equality, which soon became the Equal Protection Clause in the US government. The 14th amendment was crafted in order to uphold the ideas present in the Civil Rights Act of 1866. 


In an effort to protect black citizenship, the Fourteenth Amendment provided a universal definition of American citizenship and federal protection of that citizenship in all states.

Although it granted citizenship to African Americans, the Fourteenth Amendment did not explicitly extend the protection of voting rights to black men since it did not specifically mention the right to vote. Legally it could be assumed that the Fourteenth Amendment established equal voting rights for black men, but it was not explicitly clear that voting was a right of individual citizenship. 

Therefore, many radical Republicans in Congress felt that it was necessary to also pass an amendment guaranteeing the right to vote for blacks equal to that of whites.

#### 15th Amendment
_Ratified February 3, 1870_

The 15th amendment prohibited any state from denying or abridging a citizen’s right to vote based on “race, color, or previous condition of servitude”


Although the government has passed the amendment, by the late 1870s discriminatory practices such as Jim Crow Laws were used to prevent African Americans from exercising their right to vote. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was the act passed that stated that legal barriers were outlawed at the state and local levels if they denied blacks their right to vote under the 15th Amendment.


Discriminatory measures such as the grandfather clause, poll taxes, and all-white primaries were implemented throughout the South despite the enactment of this amendment. This disregard for law was exacerbated by the abrupt end to Reconstruction and the rise of the white-dominated Jim Crow era South, which would last until the 1960s. It was not until the Civil Rights Movement that the true meaning of the 15th amendment was observed for African Americans.
